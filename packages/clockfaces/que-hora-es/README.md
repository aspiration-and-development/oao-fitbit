## Motivation

For all Spanish lovers here from the fellow language dabbler. This is a way for me to learn by heart how to tell the time in Spanish. I hope you will find this useful as well.

If you found this project useful and there anything that you feel is not right, than your help is highly appreciated for the sake of good and proper grammar.
