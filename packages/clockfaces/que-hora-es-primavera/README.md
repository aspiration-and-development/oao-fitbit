If you wonder how it's done. I'm using nice font called [Patterns and Dots](https://www.dafont.com/patterns-and-dots.font) from [Lamuya Zimina](http://www.zimina.net/) and [Fitfont](https://github.com/gregoiresage/fitfont) module from [Grégoire Sage](https://github.com/gregoiresage) for generating images of the font, which is pretty awesome. Thank you good people!
